<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]]

This repository solves the Vehicle Routing Problem using OpenStreetMap and the Google OR-Tools library. The VRP is a classic optimization problem where a fleet of vehicles is tasked with visiting several locations to minimize the total distance and time traveled. The data used includes data from Alfamart and Indomaret stores across South Jakarta, which I grouped to contain only 2 coordinates per subdistrict.

The VRP is a classic optimization problem where a number of vehicles are tasked with visiting several locations to minimize travel costs.
Analyzing the Ozone Level detection dataset using Fast Fourier Transform, performing visualization and data reduction (PCA), and creating prediction models

This dataset contains:
   1. **nama_tempat:** contains the name of the place, either Alfamart or Indomaret
   2. **rating_tempat:** the rating of the place based on Google Maps
   3. **user_ratings_total:** the total number of users who rated the place
   4. **latitude & longitude:** the coordinates of the Alfamart or Indomaret location
   5. **alamat_tempat:** the address of the place
   6. **place_ID:** the ID of each store
   7. **store:** distinguishes whether the place is an Alfamart or Indomaret
   8. **nama_kelurahan:** the name of the subdistrict where the store is located
   9. **nama_kecamatan:** the name of the district where the store is located
   10. **nama_kota** the name of the city where the store is located

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

### Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)
[![VRP][VRP-url]
[![VRP1][VRP1-url] <br />
The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a type of transportation problem that involves distributing goods or people to customers using vehicles, with the goal of minimizing several distribution objectives.

Based on the results, it can be seen that all vehicles successfully completed their routes.

### Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP)
[![CVRP][CVRP-url]
[![CVRP1][CVRP1-url] <br />
The CVRP algorithm is the same as the VRP, except that during the chromosome selection process, vehicle capacity constraints are added. If a vehicle reaches its specified capacity, it will stop visiting points that could increase the load. Therefore, due to limitations in the data, I used dummy data to fill in the vehicle capacity gaps in the model. Based on the results, it can be seen that all vehicles successfully completed their routes and vehicle capacities.
